<h2 align="center">Hello, my name is Samuel Pinheiro ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p> I'm a Full-Stack Programmer passionate about problem solving! I started programming C# in 2019 in the area of â€‹â€‹game development, using Unity. During my career I have worked at some startups and companies where I was able to improve my skills in the most diverse areas.

Currently, I focus on Back-End development using languages â€‹â€‹such as C#, Typescript and PHP. And using the most diverse tools such as AWS and Docker.

My life goals are to develop and improve technology in order to help society. In addition to transmitting the knowledge I acquired during my journey to the next generations of programmers.
